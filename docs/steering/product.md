# Product Overview

Vault Visualizer : Turn your notes into insight.

## Context - the Why

If you're like me, and use Obsidian for personal journaling, knowledge management, or project planning, you probably have hundreds or thousands of notes. Obsidian is great for linking notes together, and helping you find specific piece of information, as long as you or organize it in a way that works for you.

However, as your vault grows, it becomes harder to get a high-level overview of your notes, and how they relate to each other. You might have notes that are linked together, but you don't know how often you link them, or what the most important notes are. You might have tags that you use frequently, but you don't know how they relate to each other.

This plugin is an attempt at solving this problem, by providing different ways to get a higher-level overview of your Vault.
