## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Monthly tracker display
**User Story:** As a note author, I want to see a monthly tracker in the note insights panel that highlights the days in the current month when the active note was linked from daily notes, so that I can quickly visualize its relevance over the current month.

### Requirement 2 - Additional info on hover
**User Story:** As a note author, I want to see a short summary about the backlinks when I hover over a day in the monthly tracker, so that I can understand how many backlinks were made from what line of daily notes on that specific day.

## Design
See FEA002 for yearly tracker, but only for current month.
