## Ideation
- Initiate global settings
- yearly tracker period configuration option: current year (January to December) vs last 12 months
- enable/disable note insight components individually (yearly tracker, monthly backlink count, etc.)


## Requirements

### Requirement 1 — Settings page
**User Story:** As a note author, I want to have a settings page for the Vault Visualizer plugin where I can configure global options, so that I can customize the plugin behavior to suit my needs.

### Requirement 2 — Yearly tracker period configuration
**User Story:** As a note author, I want to be able to change the default period for current year globally, and choose between current year (January to December) and last 12 months, so that I can better analyze the backlink trends for my notes based on my preferences.

### Requirement 3 — Enable/disable note insight components
**User Story:** As a note author, I want to be able to enable or disable individual components of the note insights panel (e.g., yearly tracker, monthly backlink count), to better reflect my analysis preferences and reduce clutter.
