Version: 1.0

## Ideation
- extends only the counter component (FEA005) for now to add pie chart visualization capability
- It allows users to see backlink distribution across the watched notes in a pie chart format
- will be supported by other components in the future (e.g., time-spent tracker)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 — Visualization Mode Selection
**User Story:** As a note author, I want to select the visualization mode in a supported note insight component to switch between standard numeric display and pie chart visualization, so that I can choose the most suitable format for analyzing backlink distribution across my notes.
